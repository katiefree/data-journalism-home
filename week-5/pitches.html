<p><strong>Population Growth and Water Scarcity</strong></p>

<p>
	Southwestern states are experiencing huge population surges, but can their reservoirs and aquifers sustain these new residents? <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/07/09/southwest-climate-change-drought/2439191/">News articles</a> have addressed this question; however, I haven't seen a great visualization that shows the intersection of population and dwindling water supplies.
</p>

<p>
	My project would be an infographic that shows population change and water supplies, and information about water in general, like maybe a diagram of different water sources like aquifers and reservoirs. I'd like to do some kind of chart or map that combines population and water. Fracking also affects water supplies, so I could include that information too. It would be neat if I did a map that changed over the past 100 years.
</p>

<p>
	I would need to use <a href="https://www.census.gov/main/www/access.html">census data</a> as well as <a href="http://water.usgs.gov/data/">water supply information</a> from the U.S. Geological Survey. There have been a lot of water studies, so I don't think that will be an issue. I could also talk to drought experts at the <a href="http://drought.unl.edu/MonitoringTools/USDroughtMonitor.aspx"> National Drought Mitigation Center</a>or the<a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Drought/">Climate Prediction Center<a> who study the Southwest and Southwestern state or city officials.
</p>

<p>
	I need to get better at Illustrator, and I need to figure out how to visualize the combined data in the most understandable way. I'll need to find the data and format it in a good way in Excel. Also, if I do end up doing a time-lapse version, I'll need to figure out how to do an interactive, looping map. 
</p>

<p>
	This is a general trend and so I think any major newspaper could potentially be interested. Alternatively, I could do a localized version and pitch it to local magazines.

<p><strong>Analysis of Famous Speeches</strong></p>

<p>
	In his 2008 speeches, Obama talked about change... over and over again. What words did Winston Churchill repeat? What about Hitler, Ronald Reagan or Martin Luther King? Words from speeches reflect the tides of public opinion and change.
</p>

<p> 
	I'd like to analyze an undetermined number of speeches to see what words famous leaders used the most. I could show this data either as a word cloud, or as a histogram. It would be interesting to take a couple of leaders and see how their speeches evolve through the good years and the bad. 
</p>

<p> 
	I'd need to scrape speeches from this <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/top100speechesall.html">famous speech archive</a> (or another if this turns out to be inaccurate), and make some kind of program that counts the frequency of each word. Then I'd need to figure out some way to make this visually appealing... so more charts and coding.
</p>

<p> 
	I think someplace like Slate or the Huffington Post would be interested in this data project.

<p><strong>Rock Salt</strong></p>

<p>
	We know this winter has been snowy, and that cities and states have used a ton of rock salt to de-ice roads. But how much? And what kind of effect does this salt have on roads and the environment? 
</p>

<p> 
	I'd like to create an interactive infographic that users can click on to learn more about environmental impact of rock salt. Right now, I'm visualizing a snow plow shelling out rock salt on a country road. Some data like the amount of rock salt used and money spent would be displayed on the front end. Then users could click on areas like the road and land to learn about impact and alternative solutions to rock salt (like Wisconsin's <a href="http://nation.time.com/2014/02/10/salt-shortage-triggers-beet-juice-cheese-brine-alternatives/">cheese brine solution</a> and Indiana's beet juice plan). I think it would be best to focus on one state like New York.
</p>

<p> 
	I'd need to reach out to New York state officials to see if they can provide this season's data to me.  I do have <a href="http://www.ogs.ny.gov/purchase/spg/awards/01800DS00.HTM">road salt delivery schedules</a> for New York State since 2002, so that could be helpful. I'd also need to scour the state's <a href="http://www.budget.ny.gov/">yearly budget</a> for money allocated to rock salt purchases. I'd also like to speak to people who are studying road salt's environmental impact. Anyone from <a href="https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/environmental-analysis/repository/cascade_lakes_final_report.pdf">this paper</a> could be a good resource.
</p>

<p>  
	A lot of this data is in .pdfs, so I'd need to learn how to scrape data from .pdfs. I need to learn how to use Illustrator better, and how to make interactive infographics that change when users hover or click the screen. Learning how to make pretty charts would be good too.
</p>

<p>  
	Since this is a local story, the only place to pitch it is New York-centric websites like The New York Times, New York Magazine, or the Huffington Post since it covers New York news too.
