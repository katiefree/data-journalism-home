<h1>7 Strategies for Growing Drought-Prone Cities</h1>

<p>California is in a massive drought these days, and part of the problem is that their population is booming. Six of the thirty fastest-growing cities in the nation are in California. But they aren't the only region that is in trouble. Texas has four of the fastest-growing cities in the nation, and from the map above, had a moderate to severe drought last year. So what's a growing and thirsty city to do? Here are seven suggestions.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Plumbers to the people</h3>
<p>San Antonio, Texas, has been working to save water for over twenty years. And that work has paid off - the average San Antonio resident uses an average of 136 gallons per day, compared to the average Californian who uses 196 gallons each day. One program they started in 1994 is Plumbers to the People, which sends plumbers out to lower-income residents who can't afford to fix leaks. This program alone has saved 494 million gallons each year.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Get rid of grass</h3>
<p>In California, watering lawns accounts for TK % of the yearly water use. Cities like Los Angeles and San Diego have responded by encouraging locals to plant native species that aren't so water-greedy. And they've instituted a "cash for grass" program that subsidizes residents to switch from grass to natives. But they can raise the bar - right now, even in a drought, San Diego residents can water their yards every day(fact check). Los Angeles residents can water three times each week. They can cut that down to one day a week, like San Antonio and Austin. Once people see their green lawns turn yellow, they may be more inspired to change over to a more sustainable yard.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Retrofit Pools</h3>
<p>Anyone flying into Los Angeles can tell you it's a city with a lot of pools. (Unfortunately, a lot of water is evaporating out of those pools. Talk about LA and their pool cover initiative. And they could also be doing a pool filtration system.) </p>

<hr>
<h3>Build green</h3>
<p>New buildings have to have in water-efficient utilities (check Austin stats and include bit about University of Texas)</p>

<hr>
<h3>Peer Pressure</h3>
<p>Talk about how public campaigns help save water - >90% of Californians say they are reducing their water use in this drought. Also, by putting how much water you use compared to your neighbors, you'll have a </p>

<hr>
<h3>Peecycling</h3>
<p>Talk about Wichita City in Texas, that has resorted to recycling their water, and also talk about how golf courses, gardens, athletic fields, etc can all do with recycled water. </p>

<hr>
<h3>Don't stop after the drought</h3>
<p>A lot of these strategies are used during the drought, but quickly swept aside once the rains begin. San Antonio has saved so much water because they've been working on water conservation for over 20 years. Other cities should follow suit.</p>
