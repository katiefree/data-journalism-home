<h2>The 30 Fastest-Growing Cities in the U.S.</h2>
<h3>Twelve of 2013's fastest-growing cities experienced moderate to extreme drought in the past year.</h4>

<h3>Peecycling</h3>
<p>Just 150 miles northwest of <b>Dallas</b>, Wichita Falls is about to become the first U.S. city to directly convert its sewage to drinking water. The city will recycle <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-22/wichita-falls-braces-for-water-from-sewers-with-texas-in-drought.html">5 million gallons</a> every day, which is a third of its daily demand, once Texas state officials approve the plan. Though it sounds icky to brush your teeth with sewer water, it's considered to be a safe and effective way to conserve water. Astronauts on the <a href="http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast02nov_1/">international space station</a> have been drinking recycled water since 2008. Wichita Falls residents may be happy to hear they won't be living the life of an astronaut for long: in the long term, the city will reroute the water to nearby Lake Arrowhead.</p>

<h3>Plumbers to the people</h3>
<p>Just one leaky toilet can waste over <a href="http://www.epa.gov/WaterSense/////docs/ws-at-work_bmpcommercialandinstitutional_508.pdf">20,000 gallons</a> each month, flushing an extra $2100 down the drain each year. To save water, <b>San Antonio</b> started a program called <a href="https://www.saws.org/conservation/CaseStudies/docs/P2P_20120402_.pdf">Plumbers to the People</a>, which sends plumbers out to lower-income residents who can't afford to fix leaks. This program alone has saved 494 million gallons each year since it began in 1994.</p>

<h3>Get rid of grass</h3>
<p>In Southern California, watering lawns accounts around 60 percent of residents' water use. Cities like <b>San Diego</b> and <b>Los Angeles</b> have responded by encouraging locals to plant native species that aren't so water-greedy. They've instituted a "<a href="http://www.socalwatersmart.com/index.php/qualifyingproducts/turfremoval">cash for grass</a>" program that pays residents up to $2 for every square foot of turf removed. Switching to native plants can reduce landscape irrigation by <a href="http://www.smgov.net/Departments/OSE/Categories/Landscape/Garden-Garden.aspx">83 percent</a> and make maintainence easier. </p>
