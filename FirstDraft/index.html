<div class="article-body" >
<p>California's in the middle of its third year of drought, and according to state officials, it has "<a href=”http://www.ca.gov/drought/news/story-41.html”>no end in sight</a>." By 2050, the problem <a href=” http://www.saveourh2o.org/node/1”>may be worse</a> - its population is expected to increase by 50 percent to 60 million and it will have to support that population with 25 percent less of its major water source, the Sierra Mountain snowpack.</p>

<p>Six of the 30 fastest-growing cities in the nation are in California. But it isn't the only region that's in trouble. Texas has four of the fastest-growing cities in the nation, and like California, it's in the middle of a bad drought. So what's a growing and thirsty city to do? Here are <b>five</b> ways cities are saving water.</p>


<hr>
<h3>Get rid of grass</h3>
<p>In Southern California, watering lawns accounts around 60 percent of residents' water use. Cities like <b>San Diego</b> and <b>Los Angeles</b> have responded by encouraging locals to plant native species that aren't so water-greedy. They've instituted a "<a href="http://www.socalwatersmart.com/index.php/qualifyingproducts/turfremoval">cash for grass</a>" program that pays residents up to $2 for every square foot of turf removed. Switching to native plants can reduce landscape irrigation by <a href="http://www.smgov.net/Departments/OSE/Categories/Landscape/Garden-Garden.aspx">83 percent</a> and make maintainence easier. </p>

<h2>The 30 Fastest-Growing Cities in the U.S.</h2>
<p>Twelve of 2013's fastest-growing cities have experienced moderate to extreme drought in the past year.</p>

<h3>Peecycling</h3>
<p>Just 150 miles northwest of <b>Dallas</b>, Wichita Falls is about to become the first U.S. city to directly convert its sewage to drinking water. The city will recycle <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-22/wichita-falls-braces-for-water-from-sewers-with-texas-in-drought.html">5 million gallons</a> every day, which is a third of its daily demand, once Texas state officials approve the plan. Though it sounds icky to brush your teeth with sewer water, it's considered to be a safe and effective way to conserve water. Astronauts on the <a href="http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast02nov_1/">international space station</a> have been drinking recycled water since 2008. Wichita Falls residents may be happy to hear they won't be living the life of an astronaut for long: in the long term, the city will reroute the water to nearby Lake Arrowhead.</p>

<h3>Plumbers to the people</h3>
<p>Just one leaky toilet can waste over <a href="http://www.epa.gov/WaterSense/////docs/ws-at-work_bmpcommercialandinstitutional_508.pdf">20,000 gallons</a> each month, flushing an extra $2100 down the drain each year. To save water, <b>San Antonio</b> started a program called <a href="https://www.saws.org/conservation/CaseStudies/docs/P2P_20120402_.pdf">Plumbers to the People</a>, which sends plumbers out to lower-income residents who can't afford to fix leaks. This program alone has saved 494 million gallons each year since it began in 1994.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Retrofit pools</h3>
<p>Anyone flying into <b>Los Angeles</b> can tell you it's a city with a lot of pools. Well, someone actually counted them. German graphic designer Benedikt Gross and aspiring geographer Joseph Lee analyzed satellite maps and counted <a href=” http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-c1-swimming-pools-20131202-dto,0,198951.htmlstory#axzz2mKp1Jn8I”>42,123 swimming pools</a> in the Los Angeles Basin. Sadly, a whole pool's worth of water <a href=” http://www.epa.gov/WaterSense/////docs/ws-at-work_bmpcommercialandinstitutional_508.pdf“>evaporates each year</a>. Pool covers can reduce evaporation by 30 to 50 percent, and cities like <b>Austin</b> and <b>Las Vegas</b> are encouraging their residents to use covers by reimbursing up to 50 percent of pool cover costs. If all of those 43,123 pools had a pool cover, it would reduce water yearly water consumption by <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/significantfigures/index.php/2013/12/03/water-policy-what-about-all-those-swimming-pools-in-los-angeles/">760 million gallons</a>. </p>

<hr>
<h3>Build Green</h3>
<p>Las Vegas, a city famous for its over-the-top casinos, fountains and flashing lights, seems like the last place that would worry about conservation. But the city gets <a href=” http://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/files/Conservation_Element.pdf”>90 percent</a> of its water from the Colorado River, and the Colorado River basin is extremely susceptible to drought. Las Vegas is working on a number of projects to conserve water, and it's managed to reduce its daily per capita water use from 300 gallons in 2002 to 225 gallons. The city is leading the country in building new homes that can save up to 75,000 gallons each year. So far, 8700 certified "Water Smart Homes" have been built, saving around 600 million gallons of water each year.  </p>
